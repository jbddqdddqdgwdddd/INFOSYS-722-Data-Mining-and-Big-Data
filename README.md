This repo stores the data mining project of INFOSYS 722: Data Mining and Big Data

This research project focuses on data mining and prediction for stroke disease. Stroke is a medical condition resulting from insufficient blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death. The study begins with an in-depth understanding of relevant background knowledge and describes the data source. By performing data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, and oversampling, data quality and completeness are ensured. To accurately predict the occurrence of strokes, three models were selected: decision trees, random forests, and LGB. Through multiple iterations of optimization and model comparisons, a reliable and accurate prediction model was developed. This model can effectively assist doctors and researchers in predicting the risk of stroke and taking timely intervention measures.
